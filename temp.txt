Data Driven Design

Test Function - Performs pre-test setup, instantiates and then initializes TestCase, prepares Test Runner Function
Test Runner Function - The actual test function, defines playwright logic

class Test
- Constructor params
  - Test Runner Function
  - Array of test cases
  - Array of rules to validate test case
- Implements builder pattern
- Ability to add hooks
  - Before all
  - Before each
- Defines static method to prepare Test Function (Test.prepare() will return a prepared Test Runner function) ??
- Defines a method for running the tests (Leverages built in playwright features)
  - Can control parallel / serial testing
  - Concurrency limiting

class TestCase<T>
- Defines a single test case
- T defines the structure of the actual test data
- Performs type validation on class variables
- ability to add before / after hooks for individual test case
